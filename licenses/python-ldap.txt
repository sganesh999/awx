Mentioning a Python style license was my fault for two reasons:

1. It is an obstacle to incorporate python-ldap into Python's standard lib.

2. It's not precise enough as you already said.

Mainly the term "Python style" was used to express that you should be able to
do whatever you're allowed to do with Python.

The two authors (David and me) writing most of the code could agree on a quite
liberal open source license. But since we did not insist on written statements
to agree upon a license for the few contributions made by others we would have
to ask all contributors. Most of them are not subscribed to the list anymore I
guess.

Frankly I'm not sure what to do to clarify this unfortunate situation.

Ciao, Michael.
